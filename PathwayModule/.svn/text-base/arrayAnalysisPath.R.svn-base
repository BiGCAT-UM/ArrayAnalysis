# DESCRIPTION : 
# inputFile <- name of the file containing statistical comparison table 
#				[give full path if the file is not present in your WORK.DIR]
# dbFile 	<- database file name (.bridgedb file corresponding to your species) 
#				[give full path if the file is not present in your WORK.DIR]
# gColorSet <- string representing a list of unique sample names (file headers), 
#				on which a gradient is applied. Sample names are separated by ";" 
#				Attribute NULL value if no gradient is required
# gColor 	<- string representing a list of list of colors: 2 to 3 colors are 
#				applied to each gradient. The first separator ";" splits the 
#				groups of colors belonging to the same gradient and the second 
#				"," splits the colors for each given gradient.
# gValue 	<- string representing a list of list of values corresponding to 
#				gColor and is organized the same way.
# rColorSet <- string representing a list of unique ids (headers no present in 
#				gColorSet or any string). These color sets may contain one or 
#				several color rules. The color set separator is ";". 
#				Attribute NULL value if no color rule is required
# rColor 	<- rColor is a string representing a list of list of colors: for 
#				each rule, only one color is set but many rules may be defined 
#				for one color set. The first separator ";" splits the  groups 
#				of colors belonging to the same color set the second "," splits 
#				the colors for each given rule.
# rExpr		<- string representing a list of list of boolean expression 
#				corresponding to rColor and is organized the same way. 
# exprZ 	<- boolean expression for zscore calculation
